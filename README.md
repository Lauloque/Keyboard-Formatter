**Formats keyboard text (kbd) in your Obsidian notes quickly and consistently.**

This Obsidian plugin allows you to select text within your notes and, with a simple keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Y by default), automatically format common keyboard keys and mouse buttons using HTML `<kbd>` tags. This provides a visually distinct and semantic way to represent user input instructions in your writing.

## Features

- **Effortless Formatting:** Select text containing keyboard key names and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>Y</kbd> to format them. For example`ctrl shift a` will become <kbd>‚åò Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>‚áß Shift</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd>.
- **Intelligent Recognition:** Recognizes common modifier keys (Ctrl, Shift, Alt, Cmd, Win, etc.) like "ctrl" as <kbd>‚åò Ctrl</kbd>, "shift" as <kbd>‚áß Shift</kbd>, "alt" as <kbd>‚å• Alt</kbd>, "cmd" or "command" as <kbd>‚åò Cmd</kbd>, "win" or "windows" as <kbd>Win</kbd>, etc. Also handles function keys (<kbd>F1</kbd>-<kbd>F12</kbd>), navigation keys (e.g., "tab" as <kbd>‚á• Tab</kbd>, "delete" as <kbd>‚å¶ Delete</kbd>, "enter" as <kbd>‚èé Enter</kbd>), and arrow keys (e.g., "up" as <kbd>‚Üë Up</kbd>, "left" as <kbd>‚Üê Left</kbd>, etc.).
- **Mouse Button Formatting:** Formats mouse buttons like "lmb" as <kbd>Left üñ±Ô∏è</kbd>, "rmb" as <kbd>Right üñ±Ô∏è</kbd>, "mmb" as <kbd>Middle üñ±Ô∏è</kbd>, and "wheel" or "scrollwheel" as <kbd>Wheel üñ±Ô∏è</kbd>.
- **Case-Insensitive Matching:** Key names are recognized regardless of their capitalization (e.g., "Ctrl", "ctrl", and "CTRL" all become <kbd>‚åò Ctrl</kbd>).
- **Single Letter Capitalization:** Capitalizes single-letter words (useful for individual key presses), like "a" becoming <kbd>A</kbd>.
- **Consistent Styling:** Uses HTML `<kbd>` tags, which can be easily styled with custom CSS to match your Obsidian theme.
- **Light and Dark themes** for everyone to enjoy!

## How to Use

1. **Install the plugin:**

2. **Format text:**
   
   - Open a Markdown note in Obsidian.
   - Select the text you want to format (e.g., `ctrl shift a`).

   - The selected text will be transformed into: `<kbd>‚åò Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>‚áß Shift</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd>` which looks like this: <kbd>‚åò Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>‚áß Shift</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd>.
