**Formats keyboard text (kbd) in your Obsidian notes quickly and consistently.**

This Obsidian plugin allows you to select text within your notes and, with a simple keyboard shortcut of your choosing , automatically format common keyboard keys and mouse buttons using HTML `<kbd>` tags. This provides a visually distinct and semantic way to represent user input instructions in your writing.

## Features

- **Effortless Formatting:** Select text containing keyboard key names and press a keyboard shortcut of your choosing  to format them. For example`ctrl shift a` will become <kbd>‚åò Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>‚áß Shift</kbd> <kbd>A</kbd>.
- **Special Keys Recognition:**
    - Common modifier keys: <kbd>&#9096; Ctrl</kbd> <kbd>&#8679; Shift</kbd> <kbd>&#9095; Alt</kbd> <kbd>&#8984; Cmd</kbd> <kbd>Win</kbd> etc.
    - Function keys: <kbd>F1</kbd>-<kbd>F12</kbd>
    - Command keys <kbd>‚á• Tab</kbd>, <kbd>‚å¶ Delete</kbd> <kbd>‚èé Enter</kbd>
    - Arrow keys "up" and "left" become <kbd>‚Üë Up</kbd> <kbd>‚Üê Left</kbd>
- **Mouse Button Formatting:** "lmb" as <kbd>Left üñ±Ô∏è</kbd>, "rmb" as <kbd>Right üñ±Ô∏è</kbd>, "mmb" as <kbd>Middle üñ±Ô∏è</kbd>, and "wheel" or "scrollwheel" as <kbd>Wheel üñ±Ô∏è</kbd>.
- **Case-Insensitive Matching:** Key names are recognized regardless of their capitalization (e.g., "Ctrl", "ctrl", and "CTRL" all become <kbd>‚åò Ctrl</kbd>).
- **Single Letter Capitalization:** Capitalizes single-letter words (useful for individual key presses), like "a" becoming <kbd>A</kbd>.
- **Light and Dark themes** for everyone to enjoy!
